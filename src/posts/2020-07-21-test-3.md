  Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all
  makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's
  going to be?

Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes
sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be?
He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're friends, like you
and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because of the
kids. They called me Mr Glass.

Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is
advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit?
It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular
gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.

Normally, both your asses would be dead as fucking fried chicken, but you happen
to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period so I don't wanna kill you,
I wanna help you. But I can't give you this case, it don't belong to me.
Besides, I've already been through too much shit this morning over this case to
hand it over to your dumb ass.
